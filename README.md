# Gender-Recognition-using-GAIT-Patterns üö∂üèª

## GAIT Background ‚û°Ô∏è 

Gait is a manner of walking or stepping and this can be used to train models to recognize
gait patterns. Human identification using techniques like biometric analysis based on
unique behavioural or physiological characteristics has become an imperative tool for
human identification. Traditional biometric techniques that include the identification
using fingerprint, face, iris etc. It has some major disadvantages. It cannot work on low
resolution images or images taken from a distance. It also requires the complete
cooperation by the user to give satisfactory results. This is not ideal in some situations
like preliminary analysis of a crime scene etc. Analysis of gait patterns can overcome
these drawbacks and hence, it has attracted attention from the computer vision experts in
recent years.
